### Short updates

- mystjs initial release!

  - https://executablebooks.github.io/mystjs
  - And many other PRs updates in the JS world (e.g. docutils state, packaging)
- release of myst-parser v0.17.0 (https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/_changelog.html), jupyter-cache v0.5.0 (https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/)
  - Both feed into https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB/pull/380
- soon-to-be-released sphinx-book-theme (v0.3). in pre-release now but haven't gotten any negative feedback. https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/releases/tag/v0.3.0rc1
- sphinx-togglebutton also released w/ smaller footprint: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-togglebutton/releases/tag/v0.3.0

### Notes

#### mystjs / myst-spec discussion (@rowanc1)

- Functionality, demo, myst "spec", reflections and thoughts on next steps!

- Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lLJUgILhBAZeLyUXucHtQGsA9OjqlSoIjop5_bFVTWg/edit

- Questions to answer

  - Should MyST exist as a first-class project within Executable Books?
    - General yes
  - Where should its "project" documentation live?
    - `myst.tools` ?
    - `spec.myst.tools`?
    - Agree to do this
    - Chris H will get the domain (UPDATE: Chris got the domain, now we just need to point something to it).
    - Figure out the following two later:
      - `python.myst.tools` -> myst-parser docs? (maybe we rename to `myst-python`)
      - `js.myst.tools` -> `mystjs` docs?
      - No decisions made here, we'll get to it later.
  - How do we avoid duplicating a bunch of documentation etc.
    - Define the core myst spec in a single repo, along with implementation-agnostic syntax
  - Unit tests of the spec - where do they live?
    - Use `chrisjsewell/myst-spec` for this?
    - Generally agree this is a good place to do it, need to consolidate docs somehow.

- myst-spec: https://myst-spec.readthedocs.io

  - Did a quick demo of the spec to compare w/ mystjs

#### myst-nb / embedding code outputs (@chrisjsewell)

- https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/681
- https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB/pull/380 is basically ready to go apart from this
  - Perhaps merge, then work on this separately?

#### Developer interviews (@mmcky)

- I will be coordinating a series of developer interviews (recorded via Zoom) on a range of topics
- Proposal: Deep dive into Parsing: myst-parser, markdown-it-py and MyST Specification
- Developer: @chrisjsewell
- Compiling questions which I will organise into a logical interview. Please add to https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/672
- Target Date: Mid-March 2022

### Agenda items

- \[Matt\] Planning to place an emphasis on Bug/Issue reduction for February (perhaps after the refactors for myst-parser, myst-nb)
  [Issue/Bug Reduction Priorities](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/649) is an issue on the meta repo to record any issues/bugs you are:
  1. able to work on
  1. really want fixed to move something forward
- \[Matt\] Organise a session with Chris S on "The architecture of Jupyter Book" to flesh out some of the areas I am not familiar with such as: markdown-it / markdown-it-py etc. to make improvements for developer docs.
  - Can you record this?! (@mmcky -- good idea)
  - Three Common Ways to Extend Sphinx
  - Overview of JupyterBook
- \[Steve\] Thebe next steps - driven by requirements for hookup to interactive web components
  - refactor to a (Typescript) core, update current js library to use it.
  - library also made available on npm.
  - Issue open for discussion here https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/issues/536
  - @mmcky If you need beta testers, we would be happy to help test on QuantEcon projects such as: https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html
- \[Chris H\] Feedback on book theme structure / visuals?
  - Demo: https://sphinx-book-theme--472.org.readthedocs.build/en/472/
  - General agreement that this looks a lot better than the current released version.
- \[Chris H\] Feedback on carets / toggle buttons
  - Demo: https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinx-togglebutton/builds/15966583/
  - Chevrons instead of + signs?
  - Widescreen toggles - could we re-use from sphinx-design ?
