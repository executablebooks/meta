### Reports, updates, and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion), short updates about what you've been up to, and shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

#### QuantEcon / ANU

- QuantEcon: 4/5 Projects running Jupyter Book (remaining: julia)
- ANU Team: Working on Support for Individual Page PDF (via LaTeX) generation (Lead: @mmcky)
    - Chris H notes that we should include updates about QuantEcon lectures conversion etc
    - @mmcky to add links to executable books gallery to QuantEcon jupyter-book powered projects

#### Chris S.

- Recent work:
  - Released [sphinx-external-toc](sphinx-external-toc.readthedocs.io) and integrated in Jupyter-Book
      - Removes a lot of code from jupyter-book 😄, moving towards JB just being a thin wrapper for sphinx-extensions (last part is basically the `_config.yml`)
      - Bit of a balancing act between; ease of use/understandanding, having a clear schema, having all the functionality of sphinx toctrees
      - Integration in JB also includes addition of "pluggable" CLI
  - Released markdown-it-py v1.0, i.e. fully stable
  - Released myst-parser v0.15.0, with sphinx v4 support
    - Should be moving all repositories to sphinx v4
  - Released [rst-to-myst](https://github.com/executablebooks/rst-to-myst) v0.3
    - Facile conversion of RST to MyST Markdown for a whole project
    - Utilises mdformat + mdformat-myst to create the Markdown from markdown-it tokens
    - Still working on mdformat-myst, but this essentially allows round trips Markdown text -> markdown-it tokens -> Markdown text. Could potentially be used for e.g. modifying links in downloadable notebooks
  - Created [markdown-it-plugin-template](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-plugin-template); template repository with best practices for TypeScript library
    - Used this to create: [markdown-it-amsmath](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-amsmath), with demo website: <https://executablebooks.github.io/markdown-it-amsmath/> and [markdown-it-dollarmath](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-dollarmath), with demo website: <https://executablebooks.github.io/markdown-it-dollarmath/>
    - Intend to make all plugins for parity with [mdit-py-plugins](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdit-py-plugins), and thus myst-parser extensions

- Intended work
  - Update  [MyST VS Code extension](https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-language-support) to use new markdown-it plugins
    - Plus hopefully LSP support
    - Look into recently finalised Notebook API: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook
  - Create sphinx-design: An iteration on sphinx-panels, but with the benefit of hindsight, and to more closely follow aspects of [Materials Design](https://material.io/design) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
      - class names that do not clash with sphinc ones (i.e. container)
      - easier to set principle colors and width defaults
  - Either in myst-parser or sphinx-design have nice way to generate stylised post-header banners, with e.g. author, date, read time (see https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/issues/372)
  - Improvements to myst-nb (+ jupyter-cache)
    - Been gradually working on it, but lot of interconnected parts 😬 
    - Revise the AST and transforms (post-transform -> transform)
    - Drop nbconvert, jupyter-sphinx dependencies
    - Better support for Markdown code output
    - Better support for "multi-level" configuration (cell level > notebook level > conf.py level)
    - Improve notebook execution and (maybe) drop `auto` mode in favour of `cache`
        - Support for dynamic kernel names
    - How to habdle glue; ideally in a kernel agnostic manner, possily with the new substitution syntax 
    - Plugin CLI in jupyter-book for notebook execution

#### Steve

- Would like to:
    - meet the team
    - hear about thoughts on Thebelab as I'm prepping to do some work there

#### Berkeley team

- :wave: to Damian, onboarding etc
- Damian is playing around with the MyST parser and learning how it is structured, experimenting with a Nikola implementation of the parser.
- Chris is going to focus more of his time on team documentation, tool documentation for both users and developers, etc.

### Agenda items

- [sphinx-multitoc-numbering PR](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/pull/1326) default behaviours (Lead: @mmcky)
- Workshop for Theme Specification (Prerequisites?, Preparation?, Timing?) (Lead: @mmcky)
- Any new features we should be focussing on from: https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/feature-vote.html
    - One possibility: `sphinx-margin` (https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/discussions/409)

**Didn't get to the following items**
- Bug issues in Jupyter Book: any important issues to address from: https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Abug
- Jupyter-book in RTD: how can we make it happen!?
    - Chris H can give a short update from a conversation he had with Eric and Juan at RTD a few days ago.
- Theming: I am still keen on creating a shared infrastructure (https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/279) and not necessarily being directly dependent on pydata-sphinx-theme
    - Although @choldgraf mentioned about possible funding from NumFocus for pydata-sphinx-theme
- MyST as specification: what does that mean, how to "de-couple" from sphinx?
    - What roles/directives/extensions are "core"?
    - How to support additional roles/directives/extensions
    - How does this tie in with "JavaScript" work (i.e. editor tools in VS Code, JupyterLab, etc)?
    - Some notes in https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-myst/blob/directives/docs/design.md

John S:
- Hiring casual RAs?

Chris H:
- Communicating the work we're doing - blog posts, tweets, etc? @executablebooks handle?
- Coordinating around deliverables, workstreams, requests for reviews, etc?
