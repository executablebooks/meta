# Team meetings

The Executable Books team has meetings on the **first Wednesday / Thursday of the month (depending on time zone) for 1 hour**.
See the calendar below for the next team meeting.

We use [this HackMD for an agenda](https://hackmd.io/THymMOAmSICp8rJdB6_Z1w?edit) and relevant meeting information.
