The [AGU 2021 conference](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting) just wrapped up, and Jupyter Book made a few appearances at the conference this year.
Below are a few links to videos and Google Slides for each session.

## Jupyter Book 101: A tutorial introduction to Jupyter Book

This was a 30 minute invited tutorial that covered the basics of getting started with Jupyter Book.
In the tutorial, we first create a book from scratch, build an HTML website from the book, add some content of our own, and then publish it online with GitHub Pages.

Below is a video from the presentation ([slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XnOY-MhtdLOIuYhOlVGLFE3XfchLnTUT84BMVVI2TmA/edit?usp=sharing)):

## MyST Markdown: An open and extensible markdown flavor for technical communication

In addition to the tutorial above, we also had a poster and short lightning talk about MyST Markdown, the extensible markdown flavor that powers a lot of Jupyter Book content.

[Here's a link to the MyST Markdown poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xqkC1L47-PyJ4UfjPVht3pDiXG3f4jJPq0NSlmaqWw8/edit?usp=sharing), and see a 3-minute lightning talk about it below.
