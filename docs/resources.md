# Team Resources

There are a few resources that the team shares to reduce redundancy, save time, and standardize our practices.
This page has a few major pieces.

## Design Assets

The Executable Books team uses [this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/ZptZUfzGznnT8GhIplnZBU/icon) to store its logo and other visual design assets.
Anybody can access these assets, though only core team members can edit them.

## Google Drive

We have [a shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lg4YpS3BpMnra4bVmkwfaTmYGYn42l3d?usp=sharing) where we store some assets like presentations and documents.
Access to this Google Drive is restricted to core team members.
