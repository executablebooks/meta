# The Executable Books Project

This is the team documentation for the
[ExecutableBooksProject](https://github.com/executablebooks), an international
collaboration to build open source tools that facilitate publishing
computational narratives using the Jupyter ecosystem.
Below are two marquee projects that we steward.
