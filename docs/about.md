# About the EBP

The Executable Book Project is an international collaboration between
several universities and open source projects. It is primarily a collaboration
between groups at [The Australian National University](https://anu.edu.au),
[Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/), and
[The University of California at Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). These teams collectively
represent many open source projects in the scientific community, specifically
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), [QIIME](https://qiime2.org/), and [The Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/).

This project is funded by a grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).
